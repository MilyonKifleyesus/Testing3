## Automated Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Component initialization and cleanup
- Input/output bindings
- Helper method logic (geocoding, coordinate projection)

### Integration Tests
Existing test: `fluorescence-map.integration.spec.ts`
- Add company flow with sub-locations
- Route creation and alignment

### E2E Tests (Playwright/Cypress)
```typescript
// Example: Add Company E2E Test
test('should add a new company and display on map', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/apps/fluorescence-map');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Add Company")');
  await page.fill('input[name="companyName"]', 'Test Corp');
  await page.fill('input[name="location"]', 'Seattle, WA');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Submit")');
  
  // Verify marker appears
  const marker = await page.locator('.node-marker').count();
  expect(marker).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```
